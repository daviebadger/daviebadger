**What** I use:

*   **Project manager**: [uv] ([cheat sheet][uv cheat sheet])

[uv]: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
[uv cheat sheet]: https://github.com/daviebadger/cheatsheets/blob/main/python/pypi/uv.md

**Why** I use:

<summary>uv</summary>

*   **purity**

    I want a dedicated Python package manager. Thus no multi-language ones like
    [conda], [mamba] or [pixi].

*   **unification**

    I want a single CLI to handle builds, dependencies, executables, packages,
    Python versions and virtual environments. Thus neither isolated ones like
    [pip], [pip-tools], [pipx], [pyenv], [setuptools], [twine] or [virtualenv],
    nor limited ones like [hatch], [pdm] or [poetry].
